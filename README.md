# Cart Catch for WooCommerce
Cart Catch allows WooCommerce stores to recover lost sales due to cart abandonment. 

We use customisable, branded, personalised email campaigns to draw customers back to your store who failed to check out.

Completely free.


### Getting started
1. Create an account at [https://app.cartcatch.com/](https://app.cartcatch.com) to receive your store ID and secret key.
2. Install and activate the plugin. Enter your store ID and secret key in the setup screen.
3. Open a new window on your store, add some items to your cart, visit the checkout page, add your email address, and close the window. We'll send you an email to remind you to checkout.
4. That's it! Start recovering sales.

This is a required plugin for the Cart Catch service to work on WooCommerce.
